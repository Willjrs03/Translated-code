main.rs includes code for an assignment made in java that i have manually translated to rust-lang.
It took a long time trying to process every portion need as rust is a low level language compared to java so much more details were needed.


two_trainsBetter.swift is a code originally made in python I translated to apple's swift language for fun. as i began learning swift 
i noticed so many more things i can change from the original file making it more "efficient" in my eyes, and so ended up using certain techniques i didnt
even know could be done in python as well.
